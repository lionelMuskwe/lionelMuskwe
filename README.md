In my, exilarating first year of Computer Science undergrad at Aston University. At Aston, I am building my foundation via creating XAMPP full stack applications and writing small scale JAVA appplications. In my spare time, my further development entails building Python (Django) web applications.

When not perusing computing articles or sat at my terminal, I indulge myself in volleyball, table tennis and kayaking. Holding leadership roles in these various clubs, I am equally responsible for planning activites, social gatherings and managing finances. To nourish my intellect, I read self-developement books and attend career development workshops.
